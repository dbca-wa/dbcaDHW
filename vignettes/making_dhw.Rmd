# Introduction
The aim of this vignette is to show an interpretation of NOAA's Coral Reef Watch 
degree heating week metric (DHW), [see here for details](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/methodology.php#dhw).

By following the vignette **Using dbcaDHW** there will be a csv of SST values 
and a folder structure that this analysis will utilise. Please read that 
vignette first if you haven't done so. 

# Degree heating weeks
The following will create 2 csv files as output. One, including *"DHW"* in the name, will contain a daily record of the the DHW for the defined **present** period. 
The other csv with *"DHWM"* in the name, will contain the overall maximum DHW 
metric achieved for each site for the defined **present** period.

First up load up other required packages, read in the previously created data and set up a few useful objects.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(tibbletime)

## read in extracted daily values
dataset <- read_csv("CRW3_1_extract_yourstartdate_yourfinishdate_SST_data.csv")

## sites
sites <- names(dataset)[-1]
g_num <- length(sites) + 1
```

Next up the **past** period and a maximum monthly mean will be calculated. For 
our purposes this metric (mmmt) will serve as the threshold temperature. Please 
adjust the **past** period date to suit your needs/data.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
## create maximum monthly mean from "past period"
mmtdata <- dataset %>%
  tidyr::gather("site", "sst", 2:all_of(g_num)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(dates < "2010-08-01") %>% #define past
  dplyr::mutate(month = month(dates),
                year = year(dates)) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(site, year, month) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(avg = mean(sst)) %>% #obtain mthly avgs
  dplyr::group_by(site) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(mmmt = max(avg)) #obtain max mthly avg
```

The DHW calculation is assisted by creating a function to do the work of a 
rolling 12 week "sum". A **present** period also needs to be defined. Again 
change this to suit your needs. Note, the code snippet below focuses on 
temperatures that exceed the mmt by 1 degree or greater as per the Coral Reef 
Watch example linked above. This may or may not suit your needs so adjust 
accordingly.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## function for rolling cusum of 12 weeks - 84 days)
dhw_calc_12 <- tibbletime::rollify(sum, window = 84)

## observation period, hotspot & dhw calc
dhw <- dataset %>%
  tidyr::gather("site", "sst", 2:all_of(g_num)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(dates >= "2010-08-01" & dates <= "2011-07-31") %>% #define present
  dplyr::mutate(month = month(dates)) %>%
  dplyr::full_join(mmtdata, by = "site") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(hspt = sst - mmmt,
                hsptm = ifelse(hspt >= 1, hspt, 0),
                dhw = dhw_calc_12(hsptm)*(1/7)) %>% #hotspot based on 1 degree
  dplyr::select(-month, -hsptm)
```

Lastly create the summary **DHWM** data and write all to csv.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
dhwm <- dhw %>%
  dplyr::group_by(site) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(dhwm = max(dhw, na.rm = TRUE))
  
write_csv(dhw, "SB_CRW3_1_SST_DHW_present.csv")    
write_csv(dhwm, "SB_CRW3_1_SST_DHWM_present.csv") 
```

To summarise. From the past period, monthly sst was calculated per site and then the maximum was chosen to represent the **maximum monthly mean temperature** or mmmt.

This single value per site was then added to the present period data where it was taken away from the observed sst. This value becomes a **hotspot** value and used as a threshold temperature. Following work outlined on Coral Reef Watch (https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/methodology/methodology.php) any hotspot value greater than or equal to one was cumulatively summed within a moving 12 week window. As the Coral Reef Watch method was based on bi-weekly hotspot data rather than daily, the cummulative summed value was multiplied by 0.14 (1/7) to arrive at the degree heat weeks metric, **DHW**.

As the **DHW** is calculated in a moving window a summary of this metric was considered as the maximum value calculated for each site for the present period, i.e. **DHWM**.

Two out puts are generated.

**SB_CRW3_1_SST_DHW_present.csv** which contains the following headers:

* `dates` - Date
* `site` - The unique site Id. There are 600 and if visualised as a grid covering Shark Bay, they start at the top left hand corner and run from left to right.
* `sst` - Sea Surface Temperature as extracted from the Coral Reef Watch version 3.1 data.
* `mmmt` - Maximum Monthly Mean Temperature.
* `hspt` - Hotspot. This is `sst` - `mmmt` giving a positive value for values exceeding the `mmmt` threshold.
* `dhw` - Degree Heating Weeks. An **NA** indicates not enough values for a 12 week calculation.

**SB_CRW3_1_SST_DHWM_present.csv** which contains the following headers:

* `site` - The unique site Id. There are 600 and if visualised as a grid covering Shark Bay, they start at the top left hand corner and run from left to right.
* `dhwm` - Degree Heating Weeks maximum.
